## A bike trip from Bennekom, Netherlands to Barcelona, Spain in winter 2019 with a baby and a dog

### We are out

Dear friends and family, 2 days ago (Saturday 16 Nov) we left NL by bike.  We are heading to Barcelona Allan, Elkita, Paco and Lupe👫👶🐶 with 2 bikes and 2 trailers🚲🚲📦📦.  After 4.5 spectacular years in Holland 🇳🇱, we are headed towards Costa Rica 🇨🇷 to another stage of our lives, close to grandparents, community and the sea 👬👭👬🚶🌊.

 We would like to share our bicycle trip through this chat 💬 open to all English speakers who want to know about the trip.

This group has a dairy format (read only) solo where only Allan and Elke can send messages.  So there is no obligation to answer 😅 and thus reduce # of messages⬇.

 If you have anything to tell us as advice, encouragement, or questions, please send us private messages or in the other shared groups.

 Feel free to leave the chat anytime  or when you are tired of seeing us in the same clothes 😬 we do not want to spam.  We promise to keep it short (as much as possible) and juicy 🍊.

### ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖

❓How was the idea born❓
Since we made the walk to Santiago Compostela = we loved slow travel.

 ❓ Why BCN❓
Since Lupe (because of her breed) can only fly through Iberia.

 ❓Why in November❓
 We wanted Paco to be 1 year old.  The goal is to arrive before Christmas in Spain.

 ❓Really all by bike❓
 We would love to but with 👶🐶 = 🐢.  We are going to do some sections by train.

### Add social sharing buttons

Simply add the following line anywhere in your markdown:

<pre><code>{% raw  %}
{% include sharing.html %}
{% endraw %}
</code></pre>

and get a nice responsive sharing ribbon.

{% include sharing.html %}

Add this at the bottom, or the top, or between every other paragraph if you're desprate for social validation.

Just remember to customize the buttons to fit your url in the `_includes/sharing.html` file. These buttons are made available and customizable by the good folks at kni-labs. See the documentation at [https://github.com/kni-labs/rrssb](https://github.com/kni-labs/rrssb) for more information.

### Font awesome is also included

<i class="fa fa-quote-left fa-3x fa-pull-left fa-border"></i> Now you can use all the cool icons you want! [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io) is indeed awesome. But wait, you don't need this sweetness and you don't want that little bit of load time from the font awesome css? No problem, just disable it in the `config.yml` file, and it won't be loaded.

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i>you can make lists...</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square-o"></i>with cool icons like this,</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-spinner fa-spin"></i>even ones that move!</li>
</ul>

If you need them, you can stick any of the [605 icons](http://fontawesome.io/icons/) anywhere, with any size you like. ([See documentation](http://fontawesome.io/examples/))

<i class="fa fa-building"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="fa fa-bus fa-lg"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="fa fa-cube fa-2x"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="fa fa-paper-plane fa-3x"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="fa fa-camera-retro fa-4x">

### Add images to make your point

Images play nicely with this template as well. Add diagrams or charts to make your point, and the template will fit them in appropriately.

<img src="images/hello.svg" alt="sample image">
