## A cycling trip from NL to BCN with two bikes, two trailers a baby and a dog

### We are out

Dear friends and family, 2 days ago (Saturday 16 Nov) we left NL by bike.  We are heading to Barcelona Allan, Elkita, Paco and Lupe👫👶🐶 with 2 bikes and 2 trailers🚲🚲📦📦.  After 4.5 spectacular years in The Netherlands, we are headed towards Costa Rica to another stage of our lives, close to grandparents, community and the sea 👬👭👬🚶🌊.

 We would like to share our bicycle trip through this chat 💬 open to all English speakers who want to know about the trip.

This group has a dairy format (read only) solo where only Allan and Elke can send messages.  So there is no obligation to answer 😅 and thus reduce # of messages⬇.

 If you have anything to tell us as advice, encouragement, or questions, please send us private messages or in the other shared groups.

 Feel free to leave the chat anytime  or when you are tired of seeing us in the same clothes 😬 we do not want to spam.  We promise to keep it short (as much as possible) and juicy 🍊.

### ---------

❓How was the idea born❓
Since we made the walk to Santiago Compostela = we loved slow travel.

 ❓ Why BCN❓
Since Lupe (because of her breed) can only fly through Iberia.

 ❓Why in November❓
 We wanted Paco to be 1 year old.  The goal is to arrive before Christmas in Spain.

 ❓Really all by bike❓
 We would love to but with 👶🐶 = 🐢.  We are going to do some sections by train.

### ------ * Day 1 * ------

Origin: Bennekom, NL <br>
 Destination: Arnhem, NL <br>
 Distance: 19.32km <br>
 Time: 1h 45min <br>

We left our house in our beloved village of Bennekom, NL. This day the goal was simply to leave the house.

We managed to leave with the help of Elke's brother/sister. We first went to the neighborhood forest to do a farewell ritual.  Then 1/2 crew including Lupe, went by train to Arnhem. Elke, Paco and Allan went by bike.  Before embarking we did a last stop at the organic store, grabbed provisions 🍞🧀 and said a few last goodbyes.

That day Bennekom was festive because Sinterklaas arrived 🎅🏻to town, we left with background music from the village parade 🎡🎼.

We left at 4pm, non-efficiently packed, overloaded trailers, pieces of the Allan's bike hanguing out (not yet installed).  But we went out 💪🏻.  Paco was in his closed trailer and with a hot water bottle.  He slept the entire trip-he was warm n' cozy🐨.  Emotions flowed and went up and down like the low hills.  The afternoon was spectacular.  The autumn trees looked like they had gold medallions hanguing down 🍂🍁. The feeling of freedom and achievement was without equal 🦅🖤.

We ended in a spectacular Airbnb to have our last night of with Elke's family in NL 🥂🍻.

### Days 2-4

Origin: Arnhem, NL
Destination: Nijmegen, NL
Distance: 21km
Time: 2h 30min

Days 2-4 were about re-arranging and re-grouping. The bike ride to Nijmegen itself was mostly in the dark since we left Arnhem very late due to a nice celebration with Elke's brother/sister the night before. Night was falling but we still decided to head out. The sunset was pink, beautiful and we went passing over the Waal. At night we went past round green lanterns and through an intergalactic tunnel.  Then google oh google pointed at dead end road 📍. We were already tired and it was cold, us wanting to get there so we were pedaling headstrong💨. The strange thing is that despite the legwork we put in it seemed that we did not advance much, we were even surpassed in speed by a running chubby lady. That was our real speed marker. Our trailers were/are quite heavy🐷! Finally we arrived at beautiful hotel Nimma, Nijmegen.

This hotel was our base for three nights. Many bags to reshuffle, Allan's bike pieces to install, Allan sick and Paco sick-ish, much sleep to catch up, next places/hotels to be arranged. After 3 days in Nijmegen the boys got well on their health. Allan got a new grill in the back of the bike and new sidebags to redistribute weight more evenly ⚖. We rested after the crazy Bennekom move out. 

Aaaah and why were we so uber slow in the end🐢? Allan was with a deflated trailer wheel which in the eagerness to arrive did not notice.

The next day we hit the road again to a little town called Odiliapeel. Tomorrow cool but sunny day:)

### Days 5-6

Origin: Nijmegen, NL
Destination: Odiliapeel, NL
Distance: 35km
Time: 4hrs

About the bike ride, it was COOLD❄🥶. Luckily we have an amazing sheepskin suit for Paco 🐥🐑, a dear gift from my FarmHack family 💙-it was put to good use. Paco rode the front seat in bullet proof manner. That is all regarding the ride. For these days what's worthy to point out my friends..... is that we CAME BACK TO WHERE WE STARTED😱. Yes oh yes. Of course things never follow plans. We couldn't deregister from the Gemeente/Municipality online. So out of the sporadic blue we had to return to Ede-Wageningen by train to deal with some administrative stuff 📄📓🖊. [IN REALITY WE DON'T WANNA LEAVE☺]. Also, as we continue to be super heavy in the trailers we decided to remove: 2 sleeping bags (shipped them back to our good friend Jan) and 4 old phones/e-waste (mailed them to Fairphone ⭕ oh yes still being circular). All in all a good 'errandy' stop before heading down more south.

### Day 7

Origin: Odiliapeel, NL
Destination: Ommel, NL
Distance: 37.6km
Time: 3.5hrs

Yes we do feel lighter <3🕊. Also today was the best cycling day so far. Amazing sun☀. Great temp. Smooth timings (Paco slept 2.5hrs). Nice picnic on the way. We are getting more used to our things and more in our rhythm. We hope to see more of that! Cheers on this Friday to all🍻! Tmrw allans b-day 🎈!

### Note

Leaving Maastricht and exiting NL soon. Sad day. 💦

### Note

Good morning friends! Sorry for msg backlog. We have been doing quite some logistics and strategizing the past days as one crew member has aborted mission 🐶 (she is fine just not enjoying trailer). Past days too much brain 🧠 time not much writing ✏ and flow time. Below past days posts read when time. Happy weekend to all 💛.

### Day 8

Origin: Ommel, NL
Destination: Kinrooi, BE
Distance: 47 km
Time: 5.5hrs

Ommel is a horse 🐎town with some of the greatest show and olympic horse riders and horses. Our BnB hosts make horse videos to sell horses all around the world. Very dedicated niche.

Today we left in direction to Maastricht, a city sticking out at the bottom of NL. The creator of the routes had recommended us not to follow the Maas river to get there as the route had an awful lot of useless turns. So we listened and choose a route that passed a bit through Belgium. Our next Airbnb was in BE too. The bike ride was nice. As always we just manage to leave when Paco's nap time is arriving so Paco is a bit grumpy right before we leave but then he falls right asleep. The ride went well and we stopped in a Jumbo supermarket to have lunch and pick up provisions. Today was Allan's b-day so of course we had a little bday party outside of the supermarket 🛒🎈🎂with some amazing sun and good looks from the villagers . Then we rode all the way to Kinrooi BE 🇧🇪. We left NL for a second but not officially. We of course had to come back🇳🇱💙! 

Well all in due celebration mode for Allan's b-day after being greated by friendly hotel hosts, we hit the streets to check out what Kinrooi was about. We had to pop 'em beers. Of course the selected dinning offering was a cozy and greasy place called Fritur Nicole 🍟🍟🙅🤣🤣. Cheers to Allan with a good fried fish. Elke was happy to have reached the Belgium side as they also had a homemade (by Nicole :) goulash which was spectacular. Next day we woke up to the  B&B t Beek Vallei and made good friends with the owners. They treated us like there sons and gave us egg sandwiches for the road 🥚🍞.

### Days 9-10

Origin: Kinrooi, BE
Destination: Maastricht, NL
Distance: unknown shit!
Time: 5.5hrs

It was the day to go back to NL. Our last stop in NL ☹.  The most southern tip of NL. They say that here the dutch have more of a latin vibe. I guess it could be felt?

Today, eventhough it was recommended against by the routes mastermind Paul Benjaminse, today we cycled along the Maas 💧. From the looks of Google it was a pretty straight ride no ferried all looked good and from the sounds of it even romantic pedalling along the river. NOT so much. The bike ride even though beautiful right next to the Maas, was quite challenging and tricky. Let's say we became very much in contact with the dutch landscape. The trail along the river was too narrow for the trailers so we had to detour a lot and as the river is borderlined with dikes then it was hopping on and off⬆⬇ the 10m steep dikes with the heavy trailers. The trail kept switching between gravel and asphalt. Paco did not sleep his nap as expected. AND Lupe was making it very clear that she does not like the trailer. It was a long tiering day 😑. We arrived in Maastricht at night completly exhausted and overwhelmed and happy to be there. As a cherry on top🍒 Lupe did a nice pee🚽 inside the hostel in a rug (super atypical behavior-we think she is quite stressed), so we had to scrub the rug 🧽. What a day!

We had 2 nights in Maastricht at pretty Green Elephant Hostel. Nice new sustainable concept. During these two days we started strategizing (part 1) what to do with Lupe🐶 since she was definitely not happy with the travelling. We decided to send her to Barcelona since we did not think we could continue with her. Luckily we found a place for her with Javi through our good friend el Nico Berges. Now the question became how do we take here. We haven't figured out this yet.

Elke was an early bird 5🦆to get the hostel washing machine before everyone else. In the afternoon we saw a bit of the old city. We went to the river sidelines and we opened Allan's gift 🎁which was planned to be delivered here with Bol.com. Finally we went to have soup and beer 🥄🍺 at a gezelig /cozy/ hygge pub. Elke had a sip of the most greatest of great beer La Duchess du Borgogne.


### Days 11-12

Origin: Maastricht, NL
Destination: Aachen, GE
Distance: 42km
Time: 6hrs

Our time in NL has officially ended 🔚🇳🇱. We left (no comment). The bike ride was amazing and torturous>read on. Who said that the Netherlands does not have hills ⛰🏔??? This southern part indeed has some and our legs were the ones that took the beating but our eyes and hearts were happy. It was beautiful. We even got a homemade rhubarb-strawberry jam at a top of a hill 🍓. Lupe continued to prove that she does not like, in fact HATES the trailer. It is like having a opera singing dog drilling your ears with her cries making the bike ride a bit unbearable and boiling points were high and boiling.💨😤. It was hard enough to pedal up the steep hills. We choose to let her run a lot but as she is short and thick she doesn't have much resistance. So again an iterative hop on hop off the bikes constantly to out her in/out.

Again the night creeped up on us. Paco quite upset we had to do an emergency diaper change on the side of the dark road. We were well illuminated with all our bike lights 💡💡so people were stopping to see what was going on. Too stressful. After a last climb we got to Aachen city we were relieved and happy. We made it another leg and we are now sure that Lupe doesn't want to ride anymore. Let's say where as Allan Elke Paco are now feeling in flow with our schedules and our things Lupe is not in flow. Sorry Lu. 

We spent 2 days in Aachen to continue strategizing (part 2). How to take Lupe to BCN? No high speed trains take her. Not all blah blah cars accept her and not many available in Aachen. See next post what we figured out.

We did however make a thinking break to the Xmas market 💚❤🕯 with beautiful church on background.

### Day 13

Origin: Aachen, GE
Destination: Dijon, FR
Distance: not valid🚙🚐
Time: not valid 🚗🚚

We were for 1 day motorized slackers cheaters 🙈 . We were struggling to find solutions to take Lupe and we just figured to rent an oversized moving van. As we have been quite slow...to make it before Xmas to BCN we needed to move a big stretch half of France. So we decided to make Dijon our stop. We love road trips and Lupe was particularly happy about it.

Logistics continue 📉📊: 
Day 13-We all move to Dijon. Day 14-Allan takes car back to Aachen. 
Day 15-blah blah car with Lupe.
Day 16-Allan train back to Dijon. 

We sure do hope logistical stuff ends so we can get into real cycling flow. Currently in Dijon for next 2 days. Happy weekend everyone!

### Note

Hi y'all! Long time no speak. Chapter 2 of diary is coming up now. Tmrw we start Chapter 3 in coast of France 🌴. Before sending chunk of posts...wanted to send this which is both too funny and too cute. Thanks for reading along the way! 💓

### Days 13-17

 Allan went up down in out 🇩🇪 🇧🇪 🇫🇷 🇱🇺 🇪🇸 in these 5 days😅 with some interesting blah blah dudes a Belgian constructor pirate and a dancing guy from Togo 😄. Meanwhile E+P got some good walking practice. Lupe was left in great hands and warm company.


### Day 18

Origin: Dijon, France
Destination: Beaune, France
Distance: 56km
Time: 6hrs

After 5 days base camp in Dijon we are ready to hit the road. Again. We missed 'em bikes 🚲. We were without Lupe so half our weight 🐷🐾was gone. It was a beautiful cycle along the Canal du Midi. For the first time were soaring/sailing/flying ⛵🦅🌬 with great sun ☀. We did a pic-nic alongside a sluice in remberance of the dutch🧀. In this part of the ride we did share the road with some cars 🚙🚕🚗. Especially when night 🌑starts creeping in (we have not mastered leaving early enough) this hightens stress levels. Luckily it was for short pieces. We arrived to fairytale  Beaune and felt welcomed like majesty 👑with a rug of Christmas lights lining the main road like a roof. SUCH a magical entrance. ✨ Beaune top hit! 🏆


### Day 19

Origin: Beaune, FR
Destination: Chagny, FR
Distance: 15.7km (aborted) 
Time: 1.2hrs

Well today we had a tricky decision to make in that we got so captivated by Beaune that we (meaning Elke) really wanted to do some sightseeing 😎. We then arranged a short 25km bike ride next day  to Fontaines that would enable us to tour in the morning. We went to the magnificient Hotel de Dieu with it's typical Bougogne ❤🧡💛💚 colored tiles. It was a hospital for the poor but with royal accomodations (who amongst other things in times of the plague pacients got wine instead of contaminated water 🍷). Sights 🕶✅. We then hit the supermarket where we had to change paco 2wice 🥃💩. A+E underprioritezed lunch and had a tiny quiche which would get us back later.

We finally headed out 2:40pm but weren't too hurried as there were only 25 km. WRONG. We did it all wrong ❌. By that time fog ☁ had come up, we cycled all through mystical vineyards 🍇with a Lord of the Rings feel thinking an orc 👺 will surprise us next turn. Freezing ❄temps rising quiclkly. Food energy didn't last even 30min. We were pedalling up and down hills completely power-less low on fuel⏬. 

Paco woke up from his nap 4:00pm. Light dimming-nervouness getting to us. Next town came up, Chagny (not our final destination). We decided to cut our trip short ✂ and went to the first cafe ☕ to strategize. The cafe/bar was full with the old town folks hitting the bar 4pm 🥂🍻🍺🥃. Turns out the whole bar helped us plan our final leg giving us tips on trains, helping us call taxis 🚕📞 and giving us moral support 💪🏻 .

We went to Chagny train station meaning to catch a short 7mim train 🚂 to our real destination Fontaines (8km away). We are quite loaded 🧱📦 and were a bit scared of being able to put it all in the train in the short stop time span. First train, cancelled ❌. Second train, cancelled ❌. Next train delayed 30min ⌛, then 40 ⏰, then 1hr 🕰. In total we waited at the train station 2hrs. Thankfully we were fully food stocked and also with heaters. But sick to our guts wanting to arrive 🤢 now. Train arrived. Asked for help to nice Syrian guy and we successfully crammed it all in the train. Next stop Fontaines. 

We arrived and had small margin for error as we were already -3°C☃❄. We had to arrive clean cut no mistakes to Airbnb. In freaking freezing cold we managed to get to address at 8pm. Home bless!


### Days 20-21

Origin: Fontaines, FR
Destination: Dracy le Fort, FR
Distance: 7.2 km (aborted)
Time: 1hr

We stayed 2 nights in Fontaines to refuge from the cold. We got to know the entire town by heart, the supermarket and the hotel/bar.

In the bar we got a sandwich and hot chocolate 🍫☕ and found out that the country was on strike 📛and all public transport was stopped. At the supermarket the owner gave Paco a red balloon which was a hit 🎈.

On our departure day we decided wake up early 🦆and hit the road early to have more margin for error since we got a bit scared by the cold on the last ride. This day the weather promised to be 9°C so we were enthusiastic. We woke up early as planned and hit the road. The early bird plan did not turn out as we expected. The temperature was still freezing due to fog and since Paco did not have his morning ritual time. Thus he 💩while sleeping in the trailer which woke him up. We wanted to go to a cafe or bar or restaurant to get something warm change paco and strategize how to proceed. However there were NONE NIET NIENTE in town. As temperatures were not rising and Paco already awake and wanting to be outside we aborted cycling again 🚳 and just got the nearest hotel where we were, Dracy le Fort.

The hotel owner was a cyclist himself 🚲❤so he gave a discount 💳and we (who seldom go to restaurants) had an exquisite spectacular fenomenal delicious french dinner at the restaurant 🍽👌🏻.


### Day 22

Origin: Dracy Le Fort, FR
Destination: Lyon/Vienne, FR
Distance: not valid🚐
Time: not valid🚐

We wanted to make it to Lyon in the next days to meet Farmhack Anne 💙 (an incredible lady whom elke works with) who was gonna move all the way down to cycle with us for 2 days. The courage🦁! BUT
We were moving too slow. We were approaching a leg which was not cycle friendly (shared path with cars🚲🚛). All trains cancelled till the 14th. At some point we would need to make another jump forward and we were getting tempted by warm temperatures and sun in the south of France☀. We pain in ❣ (as this would mean meeting Anne note possible)  decided it was time to move forward ⏩. We found an amazing rental company Rent and Drop and rented a van 5km from where we were staying and we able to rent one way and drop in Montpellier saving Allan driving time😅. We bought an emergency second hand baby seat 👶 and road trip started! We had unlimited kms woop! 

First stop was in Lyon for some admin paperwork printing 📄 for Elke. Only to discover that day Lyon hosted La Fête des Lumières 💛💡🕯. 

The tough part was that it started at 8pm and there were no hotels or accomodations available in Lyon. Elke worked her magic and got a place in Vienne 50km from Lyon. Paco napped, then picnic in the van and then light festival ❤🧡💛💚💙💜. It was packed and there was so much police and military 👮🏻and some small manifestations which had us a bit on edge, but we finally got to a beautiful show in a gorgeous plaza with a horse statue 🐎 . It was glamorously lit and featured underwater creatures floating in the air with great soundtrack. Paco with big eyes already, had them about to pop 👀 . We were wondering what is he recording in his subconscious 🤔🧠 after seeing all this. That was all we needed, a taste of it and we left. We really enjoyed it and off to Vienne happy to have a bed to sleep in.

### Day 23

Origin: Vienne, FR
Destination: Avignon FR
Distance: not valid 🚐
Time: not valid🚐

The ride was short today so we did some sight seeing 🕶 from the van 💁. We even had a small picnic on the Rhone river banks in the wine town of Tournon. It was a beautiful day (best we've had in a long time☀👌🏻) and we were specially happy because thia day we were going to meet our good friend Yann ❣from Wageningen and he was going to host us at his place 🤩. We arrived at 6pm and were mesmerized by the walled city 🕌, beautifully illuminated. We drove around town while Paco woke up from his nap and then headed to Yann's. It was so nice to see his place. He prepared us an amazing stew and we had some nice talks and nice wine 🍷💭and we had dinner with his roommate and he gave us a quick tour of the city. It is magical. We had a really nice night and happy to be with friends 👭👫👬.

### Day 24

Origin: Avignon, FR
Destination: Agde, FR
Distance: not valid 🚐
Time: not valid🚐

We drove almost 2 hours from Avignon to our new destination Agde. Everything was going well but of course there is always SOMETHING because A+E tend to always be on the edge. We did not have a place to stay yet. Shit. We had a time crunch since we had to return the car as well. Once we arrived to Agde and had no place, Airbnb responses not coming, the time ticking ⏰. We finally got something...just something so this message deserves few icons. Allan drove back to Montpellier and now is waiting to get the one of the only trains to head back to Agde. Tomorrow the biking continues :) chapter 3💌.


### Day 25

Origin: Agde, FR
Destination: Beziers, FR
Distance: 33km
Time: 4.5hrs

Write this message now as we have arrived (2hrs ago) to Beziers! Wooppp 🥳🥳🥳! For first time, we are not busy surviving or managing challenges🤘. When natural elements are not all against you = ride and day was arrowhead + easy + simple💘. No story or adventure attached. Phewwwwww needed at least one of those😅. Thought my lines would end there. 

BUUUUUTTTTTTTT

Really really funny...😂 The place we booked in Booking.com is a brand new residential 2019 top quality amenities in nice area of the city. HowEVERRRRRR to our surprise it's part of a fancy elders home🧙🏻‍♀🧙‍♂. The top floor is full of hotel-like rooms not used so they rent them out in booking. So entrance to lobby was quite funny 😆. Us all with bikes+helmets+ mud+trailers+baby and group of cool elders having chill afternoon drinks looking at us the parade arriving👫👶🚲🚲📦📦. Of course paco was hit of the afternoon for the seniors. 

We arrived early so heading out to town Xmas carnival 🎡🎢🌭🍿🍩✨.


### Lupe Update

Quickly to get everyone in sync, Lupe🐶 is doing amazing with her new carer. There is a lot of love💓 and tenderness between them.

Since it was not 💯  clear how we took her to Barcelona here are the steps:

1⃣ When in Aachen we found a place for her to stay in Barcelona via our friend Nico Berges with his friend and now our friend Javi

2⃣ We drove in a rented van from Aachen to Dijon France

3⃣ Allan and Lupe🐶 took a Bla Bla car (shared ride) with a Belgian pirate☠ in an army green truck/camper🚙 from Dijon to Barcelona (8hrs) and arrived at 2:30am after some funny incidents.

Lupe made friends with Javi really fast and Javi has been taking her to his work at We Work so she has been having a lot of great attention. Thanks Nico and thanks Javi and thanks Belgian pirate!


### Note

Hi all 💌. We are 1 day from our trip end. We are in Spain and tmrw we cycle our last leg 38km to BCN. See below Chapter 3 posts. Wanted to send this today so you could all be with us tmrw in our last kilometers before the finish line 🏁🏁🏁🏁🖤🤍.

Greetings desde España!

### Days 26-28

Origin: Beziers, FR
Destination: St-Marcel-sur-Aude, FR
Distance: 40.9km
Time: 4.75hr

We spent two days at the elders residence🐰. Elke got 'em biking bluesssssss 🛵🏎😕. Maybe the rainy day, maybe the fear of next part of the route (included some car roads), or maybe body in need of meat🥩? I was finding trouble getting full throttle 🧨💣for next chapter. Nothing like finding AND booking a super airbnb with friendly host, top notch amenities & pool, and cheap to shake them blues off.  We also hit the local town fair (yesterday evening closed) where we had a dosis of churro n' crepe and Paco had a taste of the fair rides. Paco also getting quite the hang of being bipedal human🦶🦶.

Next we headed out towards St. Marcel-sur-Aude. The sun also showed itself quite prominent this day! The first part of the route had one of most iconic pieces of the whole journey-an old bridge ⛩that carries the Canal du Midi.  We couldn't believe we were cycling up that gem of history and that we had such a cool starting point, the triple view of: a) the river beneath us b) the canal next tu us c) the city of Beziers in the background 💕.

Again we had a really smooth ride. Great weather, passing along pretty medieval mini towns, no route mishaps. We were quite slow the first part due to gravel and wind against us and took 3 hours for 15km-had 18 more to go. We thought we were gonna hit the night and arrive super late. But we got speedy gonzales going 🐹💨 and did them in 1 hr!! arriving quite timely to the 🤩 airbnb!

Here we will stay 2 days again doing logistics stuff for our arrival in BCN. OMG it's getting to that point yes!

### Day 29

Origin: St-Marcel-sur-Aude, FR
Destination: Port-la-Nouvelle
Distance: 43.6km
Time: 6hrs

Today we made a choice that will have its sequel as you will see in next post. But this is part 1 📗. We derouted from Paul Benjaminse's route 😱. Elke is not a fan of the roads shared with cars and it seemed from Google Street images this part had some of these. [We will later find out that this was not the case-even if car road, very few cars pass by this route]. Also Paul's route went by the mountains ⛰slowly finding the Pyrenees. Even though he had advised us to stop at certain point before reaching full Pyrenees due to trailers, this part was still theoretically doable by us.  But still it had quite a slope  and we were doubting if we could do it with our weight. By the way, the plan was to somehow arrive close to the city of Perpignan were we will rent a van to cross the Pyrenees. 

ALSO, googles alternative rute was a flat route that also passed by a natural park where you cycled along a thin strip of land in between two lagoons and the ocean in the background. We hadn't seen the ocean yet 🌊 and were a tempted by that geographical uniqueness. Finally, in two days this route would leave us quite close to Perpignan (13 km away) easy enough for Allan to bike to rent the van. The mountain route alternative will still leave him 25km away. Although there was a bus from Estagel, the national strike status has left us pretty immobilized by public transport. For all the reasons above we opted for google's national park route 📍.

Before leaving the Airbnb Allan did a tire repair for Elke's trailer. We were unsure if it had a puncture or if it was the valve. We had to inflate it every cycly day for the past week as it lost a bit of air each night. The pool served it's good use to find a tiny miniscule rupture 💧🛁🧐. Trailer fixed and thankfully first puncture in the trip 🙏🏻.

We headed out. The main goal for today was to make it early enough (with sunlight) to the strip were three waters border strip of road. The cycle today was all bordering the Canal du Robin and 70% of it was within the Narbonnaise National Park 🌲. So few car risk, immersed in nature. Due to gravel road we were slow(er) but we made it just in time to the strip! We were quite happy of the victory of the race against the sun 💪🏻. Night fell short after. We still had 6km to pedal in the park before arriving to our destination Port-la-Nouvelle. It was a beautiful sight when admist the trees 🌳🌳🌳🌳, there appeared the first glimpse of port lights 🔦 first reflected in the canal water next to us. Such a comforting feeling when you see the light from the distance that welcomes you into the new towns walls 💛💛💛.

We arrived to the Port and booked the first hotel with big lighted sign: Hotel Restaurant Du Port ⚓🚢.


### Day 30

Origin: Port-la-Nouvelle, FR
Destination: Rivesaltes, FR
Distance: 50km
Time: 6hrs

Dreams play interesting roles in physical outcomes😴💭. Today Elke woke up with a regretful-like dream of having de-routed from Paul's marked route. 

 Before leaving the cool pool Airbnb we had sent an email to Paul (route creator) asking him about 1) following his  mountain route or 2) following Google's ocean national park route. Yesterday when we already were on the road, we got a response by Paul saying that the route from his book was quite more scenic and that there were not many cars on the road. His last line as if marking what was yet to come ahead of us was: 'With only three days left maybe I would not take many risks'. 🧙‍♂

Google friend or foe🙃🙂? The sequel📕. And no not all stories have a Cinderella end 👸.  Today was our second to last biking day. Again the goal was to arrive close to Perpignan (in a town called Rivesaltes) where we would rent the van. 

Before leaving the hotel we had a discussion on if to correct back to Paul's route🔀. After juggling a couple of scenarios, we choose to keep our current route. We choose to stick to our decision even if it was a wrong decision. Correcting to Paul's route, always left Allan far from the city center making it difficult to rent the van. We prioritized focus on finishing the trip rather than seeing the beautiful fortress-like sceneries. Thing is, as you will read in the following lines, it was not only the sceneries we would skip. De-routing from Paul's route actually meant a loss in safety and comfort. 

We left the port with wierd feelings. First 5km were ok through a good highway road  passing through the national park but very few cars and nice scenes. Then that road merged into other highway of medium importance. We were left on the  shoulder of the road and camper vans and cars gazing past us with hot wheels zzoom 🔥. After 10km of this Elke (who hates cars-gets really nervous and especially with baby sleeping on back) stopped dry and suggested to re-route🙋‍♀. Paco woke up, we had a roadside pic nic and planned the re-route (to be clear this was not to Paul's route, it was an emergency re-route invented by us taking us more through country roads).

Well with this re-route, all that we didn't want to climb we climbed ♐⬆⤴🔝!!! First up on this change, was a strong pedal up a 184m mountain. The climb was through the beautiful town of Fitou. We finally made it to the peak with exhausted legs, specially Allan. The sun came out and the road was gorgeous with beautiful views from the peak.
We were up with them birds, clouds and windmills 🦅☁. Safeguarded from the main highway, going past these nice landscapes...we started feeling like we had finally made one right choice. This got Allan like 'la vie es un reve/life is a dream' 🕺. Elke kept emotions at bay, not trusting until the end.

Google friend or foe? Strike 2 ⚾. We were well up that mountain. Up next we had to go to a midway town called Opoul. Both Google and a road sign pointed at a road to Opoul that broke off from the main one. Seemed like a good shortcut, paved road, and we could see in the map it will then rejoin the main road again. What's the worst that could happen? Even if it did, this shortcut was only about 2km long. Pffffff think again. 10min into cycling, pavement ended. Light gravel is ok but baseball-like rocky mountain gravel is another story.  We were off our bikes pushing bikes and trailers. Then 10m deep road dips showed up. Physics vrs Elke=literally couldn't push bike up those steep gravelly slopes. Elke was crying 💧all throughout this part. Crying is not accurate, more wailing out 💦. Freaking surprises and sporadic stupid challenges stop showing the hell up!!!! Stop IT❌⛔🚫 and let us finish!!  Elke was physically drained and mentally close to break (but at the same time couldn't- we were in the middle of nowhere what are you gonna do). Elke was the navigator and felt responsible for the past decisions and also going off the book...ohhhhh. It's not so much breaking the rules that hit...it was re-inventing the wheel the walk way from the route science + expertise  crafting these routes. The 2km shortcut felt like an eternity ♾.

Funny thing is...you know how weeping (as in crying) sounds borderline like laughter? Well Paco who all this time was in the front seat of Allan's bike thought Elke was die hard laughing out 😂🤣😁!! So he was chuckling all the way down 😍😍😍😍. Babies= really 😇.

230m push...100m push...I see the main roadddddd 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳. We connected to the main road. Had 13km to go it was 4pm, 1.5hrs before night hit. Good thing (because when you have hit rock bottom there can always be a a good thing)...good thing was...we had done all our climbing. So all the next part was downhill ⬇. We stopped in Opoul, asked a neighbor for water as we had run out. Put Paco in his trailer to sleep and pedalled down. 

We blazed through the night and in no time the pretty lights and bridge that greeted us to Rivesaltes showed up. We arrived to the hotel. Game OVER🕹🖲!

### Day 31

Origin: Rivesaltes, FR
Destination: Mataró, ES
Distance: not valid 🚚
Time: not valid 🚚

To be on the same page the plan ahead was:
1) Sun 15: arrive close to Perpignan.
2) Mon 16: rent a van, cross the Pyrenees, stop van at Mataró (we are now realtime here)
5) Tues 16: last cycling day of the whole trip. Cycle 33km from Mataró to Barcelona where a non-car + cycling friendly path starts.

Allan returned safely home after returning to France to return the van. 

Last cycling day is tmrw OH WOW.  For those who love dates today one exact month ago Nov 16, we left Bennekom 🤍. 

As rain was supposed to come tmrw at 1pm we are planning to have an early dawn cycle and be in BCN our last destination of the trip tmrw by 1pm. Not sure if we will wake up 🙊.

Too tired to write more 🤗.


### Note

Heading out last leg! No dawn wake or anything 🙊. But rain left (in theory).

Barcelona 🚲🖤🚴🏼‍♀🚴‍♂👶🐶


### Day 32

Origin: Mataró, ES
Destination: Barcelona, ES
Distance: 38km
Time: 4.75hrs

This message was still missing 😬. On Dec 17th, we pedalled our last 38km into Barcelona all along a coastal cyclpath. This day the only challenge was not getting splashed by the sea 🌊💦💙. Without knowing, the ending point in the bike route was the Mirador de Colom, a statue of Christopher Columbus pointing to the Americas. Hero or not, colonizer or not (or yes 🙃), this was where our GPS marked 0.0m making an unintentional introduction to our next destination and stage in life, Costa Rica.

Throughout this last leg we were thinking about our whole journey. We had thought the most sense of accomplishment had been felt on day 1, the exit from Bennekom. The very intense months of preparation, work, move out before the trip gave the NL house exit a special satisfaction. Nonetheless, when arriving to the BCN plaza seing the statue and realizing we had done it.... in our own format (winter bike car baby dog picnic unit) was pretty sweet too 🏁🤩.

Upon arrival, we got reunited with dear Lupe 🐾 by meeting Javi at an amazing Venezuelan restaurant where we celebrated our conclusion with plenty beers 🍻🍺and arepas. We then spent more days with Elke's cousin and wife. They hosted us in their newlywed home and we cooked hiked talked about sharks (they love to dive with them in CR)🦈.

After BCN we got reunited with Elke's family and Allan's youngest brother and wife. We did a complot to celebrate the entry to new year and decade in the EU and say goodbye to the old continent in Portugal 🥂🥳. Pure good old family time!

The reason we write this message today is because yesterday was the real trip end. Yesterday we flew from Madrid to Costa Rica, following what our ancestors had done a while back. This is not only the end but it is why it all started: to bring Lupe to Madrid as she can only fly with Iberia to Costa Rica. We have now arrived to the tropics!

This message serves as a double dip 🍦🍦. First as the last documentation of our bike end and CR arrival. Then to send our best wishes for you all for this new year and decade 2020. Third, thanks for reading along and being personally interested in our adventure. Fourth we will be waiting in Costa Rica amongst with other beings 🐸🐠🦀☀ 😉.


Finally if anyone is interested in the route or others across Europe, be sure to check the website and books of Paul Benjaminse here:  www.cyclingeurope.nl. We just bought his books and sent over a few questions by email and he was the kindest wisest most savy route cyclist we could ever find. Thanks Paul! 

Cheers from the garden and strong beats 💓 to all!

Elke Allan Paco Lupe 🚶‍♀🚶‍♂👶🐶
